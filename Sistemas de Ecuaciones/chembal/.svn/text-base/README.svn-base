To run, simply type

java -jar chembal.jar <equation>

Here are some examples of valid equations:

Cu + HNO3 + Cu(NO3)2 +NO+H2O
Na2CO3 + HCl --> NaCl + CO2 + H2O
H2O + H^ + Cl^- + MnO4^- + Cl2 + Mn^2

In general, standard chemical notation may be used.  ^ denotes charges; ^ is a +1 charge, ^- is a -1 charge, ^3 and ^-3 are +3 and -3 charges, repsectively.  Note you will need to either put quotes around the equation or do a fiar amount of escaping.

If, for some reason, you would like to build a new .jar from source, just run 'make' in this folder.
